Argued April 23, 2013\\xe2\\x80\\x94Decided June 13, 2013\\nThe Red River Compact (or Compact) is a congressionally sanctioned\\n  agreement that allocates water rights within the Red River basin\\n  among the States of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana.\\n  The area it governs is divided into five separate subdivisions called\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReaches,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d each of which is further divided into smaller \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubbasins.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n  At issue here are rights under the Compact to water located in Okla-\\n  homa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s portion of Reach II, subbasin 5. In Reach II, the Compact\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n  recognizing that Louisiana lacks suitable reservoir sites to store wa-\\n  ter during high flow periods and that the upstream States (Texas,\\n  Oklahoma, and Arkansas) were unwilling to release their own stored\\n  water for the benefit of a downstream State\\xe2\\x80\\x94granted control over\\n  the water in four upstream subbasins (subbasins 1 through 4) to the\\n  States in which each subbasin is located and required that water in a\\n  fifth subbasin, subbasin 5, be allowed to flow to Louisiana at certain\\n  minimum levels. Section 5.05(b)(1) of the Compact gives the States\\n  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cequal rights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the use of subbasin 5\\xe2\\x80\\x99s waters when the flow is 3,000\\n  cubic feet per second (CFS) or more, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprovided no state is entitled to\\n  more than 25 percent of the water in excess of 3,000 [CFS].\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Under\\n  the Compact, States are also entitled to continue with their intra-\\n  state water administration.\\n     Petitioner Tarrant Regional Water District (Tarrant) is a Texas\\n  state agency responsible for providing water to north-central Texas\\n  and its rapidly growing population. After unsuccessfully attempting\\n  to purchase water from Oklahoma and others, Tarrant sought a wa-\\n  ter resource permit from the Oklahoma Water Resources Board\\n  (OWRB), respondents here, to take surface water from a tributary of\\n  the Red River at a point located in Oklahoma\\xe2\\x80\\x99s portion of subbasin 5\\n\\x0c2        TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\\n\\n                                 Syllabus\\n\\n    of Reach II. Knowing that the OWRB would likely deny its permit\\n    application because of Oklahoma water laws that effectively prevent\\n    out-of-state applicants from taking or diverting water from within\\n    Oklahoma\\xe2\\x80\\x99s borders, Tarrant filed suit in federal court simultaneous-\\n    ly with its permit application, seeking to enjoin the OWRB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enforce-\\n    ment of the state statutes on grounds that they were pre-empted by\\n    federal law in the form of the Compact and violated the Commerce\\n    Clause by discriminating against interstate commerce in water. The\\n    District Court granted summary judgment for the OWRB, and the\\n    Tenth Circuit affirmed.\\nHeld:\\n    1. The Compact does not pre-empt the Oklahoma water statutes.\\n Pp. 9\\xe2\\x80\\x9322.\\n       (a) Tarrant claims that \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1) creates a borderless common\\n in subbasin 5 in which each of the signatory States may cross each\\n other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boundaries to access a shared pool of water. Tarrant observes\\n that \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cequal rights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d language grants each State an equal\\n entitlement to subbasin 5\\xe2\\x80\\x99s waters, subject to a 25 percent cap, and\\n argues that its silence concerning state lines indicates that the Com-\\n pact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drafters did not intend the provision to allocate water accord-\\n ing to state borders. The OWRB counters that \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cequal\\n rights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d afford each State an equal opportunity to use subbasin 5\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ex-\\n cess water within each State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own borders, but that its silence on\\n cross-border rights indicates that the Compact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drafters had no in-\\n tention to create any such rights in the signatory States. Pp. 9\\xe2\\x80\\x9311.\\n       (b) Because interstate compacts are construed under contract-\\n law principles, see Texas v. New Mexico, 482 U. S. 124, 128, the Court\\n begins by examining the Compact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s express terms as the best indica-\\n tion of the parties\\xe2\\x80\\x99 intent. However, \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s silence is, at the\\n very least, ambiguous regarding cross-border rights under the Com-\\n pact, so the Court turns to other interpretive tools to shed light on\\n the drafters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 intent. Three things persuade the Court that the Com-\\n pact did not grant cross-border rights: the well-established principle\\n that States do not easily cede their sovereign powers; the fact that\\n other interstate water compacts have treated cross-border rights ex-\\n plicitly; and the parties\\xe2\\x80\\x99 course of dealing. Pp. 11\\xe2\\x80\\x9322.\\n         (1) The sovereign States possess an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabsolute right to all their\\n navigable waters and the soils under them for their own common\\n use.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Martin v. Lessee of Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 410. So, for example,\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x9c \\xe2\\x80\\x98[a] court deciding a question of title to [a] bed of navigable water\\n [within a State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boundaries] must . . . begin with a strong presump-\\n tion\\xe2\\x80\\x99 against defeat of a State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s title.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d United States v. Alaska, 521\\n U. S. 1, 34. It follows, then, that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]f any inference at all is to be\\n drawn from\\xe2\\x80\\x9d silence in compacts touching on the States\\xe2\\x80\\x99 authority to\\n\\x0c                   Cite as: 569 U. S. ____ (2013)                      3\\n\\n                              Syllabus\\n\\ncontrol their waters, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is that each State was left to regulate the ac-\\ntivities of her own citizens.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Virginia v. Maryland, 540 U. S. 56, 67.\\nTarrant contends that \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s silence infers that the signatory\\nStates dispensed with the core state prerogative to control water\\nwithin its borders. But since States rarely relinquish their sovereign\\npowers, the better understanding is that there would be a clear indi-\\ncation of such devolution, not inscrutable silence. Tarrant counters\\nthat its interpretation would not intrude on any sovereign preroga-\\ntive of Oklahoma, which would retain its authority to regulate the\\nwater within its borders. But adopting Tarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reading would nec-\\nessarily entail assuming that Oklahoma and three other States si-\\nlently surrendered substantial control over their waters when they\\nagreed to the Compact. Pp. 14\\xe2\\x80\\x9316.\\n        (2) Looking to the customary practices employed in other inter-\\nstate compacts also helps in ascertaining the parties\\xe2\\x80\\x99 intent. See,\\ne.g., Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S. 330, ___. Many compacts\\nfeature unambiguous language permitting signatory States to cross\\neach other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s borders to fulfill obligations under the compacts, and\\nmany provide for the terms and mechanics of how such relationships\\nwill operate. The absence of comparable provisions in the Red River\\nCompact strongly suggests that cross-border rights were never in-\\ntended to be part of the agreement. Tarrant claims that not all inter-\\nstate compacts have such explicit language, but cites only one such\\ncompact, and even it sets out a detailed scheme that would apply to\\nany contemplated diversions. Similarly, even if \\xc2\\xa72.05(d) of the Com-\\npact, which gives \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[e]ach Signatory State . . . the right to\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[u]se the\\nbed and banks of the Red River and its tributaries to convey stored\\nwater, imported or exported water, and water apportioned according\\nto this Compact,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is read to establish cross-border diversions, it does\\nso through express language, not through an inference from silence.\\nPp. 16\\xe2\\x80\\x9320.\\n        (3) The parties\\xe2\\x80\\x99 conduct under the Compact also undermines\\nTarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position. See Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U. S., at ___.\\nOnce the Compact was approved in 1980, no signatory State pressed\\nfor a cross-border diversion until Tarrant filed suit in 2007. And Tar-\\nrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earlier offer to purchase water from Oklahoma was a strange\\ndecision if Tarrant believed the Compact entitled it to demand water\\nwithout payment. Nor is there any indication that Tarrant, any oth-\\ner Texas agency, or Texas itself previously made any mention of\\ncross-border rights within the Compact; and none of the other signa-\\ntory States has ever made such a claim. P. 20.\\n        (4) Tarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remaining arguments\\xe2\\x80\\x94that its interpretation is\\nnecessary to realize the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstructure and purpose of Reach II\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and that\\n\\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 25 percent cap on each State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s access to subbasin 5\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ex-\\n\\x0c4         TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\\n\\n                                  Syllabus\\n\\n    cess water implies that if a State cannot access sufficient water with-\\n    in its borders to meet the cap, it must be able to cross borders to\\n    reach that water\\xe2\\x80\\x94are unpersuasive. Pp. 20\\xe2\\x80\\x9322.\\n       2. The Oklahoma water statutes also do not run afoul of the Com-\\n    merce Clause. Tarrant claims that the statutes discriminate against\\n    interstate commerce by preventing water left unallocated under the\\n    Compact from being distributed out of State. But Tarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assump-\\n    tion that some water is left \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunallocated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is incorrect. The interpre-\\n    tive comment for Article V of the Compact makes clear that when the\\n    flow is above 3,000 CFS, \\xe2\\x80\\x9call states are free to use whatever amount\\n    of water they can put to beneficial use,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d subject to the requirement\\n    that if the amount of available water cannot satisfy all of those uses,\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceach state will honor the other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to 25% of the excess flow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If\\n    more than 25 percent of subbasin 5\\xe2\\x80\\x99s water is located in Oklahoma,\\n    that water is not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunallocated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; rather, it is allocated to Oklahoma\\n    unless and until another State calls for an accounting and Oklahoma\\n    is asked to refrain from utilizing more than its entitled share.\\n    Pp. 22\\xe2\\x80\\x9324.\\n656 F. 3d 1222, affirmed.\\n\\n    SOTOMAYOR, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\\n\\x0c                       Cite as: 569 U.

Petitioner Tarrant Regional Water\\nDistrict (Tarrant), a Texas agency, claims that it is enti-\\ntled to acquire water under the Compact from within\\nOklahoma and that therefore the Compact pre-empts\\nseveral Oklahoma statutes that restrict out-of-state diver-\\nsions of water. In the alternative, Tarrant argues that the\\nOklahoma laws are unconstitutional restrictions on inter-\\nstate commerce. We hold that Tarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims lack merit.\\n                            I\\n                           A\\n  The Red River (or River) begins in the Llano Estacado\\nMesa on the border between New Mexico and Texas.\\nFrom this broad plain, it first runs through the Texas\\nPanhandle and then marks the border between Texas and\\nOklahoma. It continues in an easterly direction until it\\nreaches the shared border with Arkansas. Once the River\\n\\x0c2     TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\nenters Arkansas, it turns southward and flows into Loui-\\nsiana, where it empties into the Mississippi and Atchafa-\\nlaya Rivers.\\n   As an important geographic feature of this region, the\\nRed River has lent its name to a valley, a Civil War cam-\\npaign, and a famed college football rivalry between the\\nLonghorns of Texas and the Sooners of Oklahoma. But\\ncollege pride has not been the only source of controversy\\nbetween Texas and Oklahoma regarding the Red River.\\nThe River has been the cause of numerous historical con-\\nflicts between the two States, leading to a mobilization of\\ntheir militias at one time, Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S.\\n574, 580 (1922), and the declaration of martial law along a\\nstretch of the River by Oklahoma Governor \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlfalfa Bill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMurray at another, see Okla. H. Res. 1121, 50th Legisla-\\nture, 2d Sess. (2006) (resolution commemorating \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlfalfa\\nBill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Murray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions during the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRed River Bridge War\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nSuch disputes over the River and its waters are a natural\\nresult of the River\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distribution of water flows. The Riv-\\ner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s course means that upstream States like Oklahoma\\nand Texas may appropriate substantial amounts of water\\nfrom both the River and its tributaries to the disadvantage\\nof downstream States like Arkansas and especially Lou-\\nisiana, which lacks sufficiently large reservoirs to store\\nwater.\\n   Absent an agreement among the States, disputes over\\nthe allocation of water are subject to equitable apportion-\\nment by the courts, Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605,\\n609 (1983), which often results in protracted and costly\\nlegal proceedings. Thus in 1955, to forestall future dis-\\nputes over the River and its water, Congress authorized\\nthe States of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas\\nto negotiate a compact to apportion the water of the Red\\nRiver basin among themselves. See Act of Aug. 11, 1955,\\nPub. L. 346, 69 Stat. 654. These negotiations lasted over\\n20 years and finally culminated in the signing of the Red\\n\\x0c                   Cite as: 569 U.

Without any such release, there would be no\\nguaranteed flow of water to Louisiana.\\n  The provisions of the Compact relating to Reach II were\\ncrafted to address this problem. To this end, Reach II was\\ndivided into five subbasins. The upstream subbasins,\\nnumbered 1 through 4, were drawn to end at \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexisting,\\nauthorized or proposed last downstream major damsites,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nsee, e.g., \\xc2\\xa75.01(a), id., at 22, on the tributaries leading to\\nthe Red River before reaching the main stem of the River.\\nThese dams allow the parties managing them to control\\nwater along the tributaries before it travels farther down-\\nstream and joins the flow of the main stem of the River.\\nFor the most part, the Compact granted control over the\\nwater in these subbasins to the States in which each\\nsubbasin is located.2 The remaining subbasin, subbasin 5,\\ninstead requires that water be allowed to flow to Louisi-\\nana through the main stem of the River at certain mini-\\nmum levels, assuring Louisiana an allocation of the River\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nwaters and solving its flowthrough problem.\\n  The provision of the Compact central to the present\\ndispute is \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1), which sets the following allocation\\nduring times of normal flow:\\n       \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(1) The Signatory States shall have equal rights to\\n     the use of runoff originating in subbasin 5 and un-\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n   2 Within subbasins 1, 2, and 4, water was fully apportioned to a single\\n\\nState.

Only subbasin 3, which includes\\nportions of Oklahoma and Arkansas, breaks from this pattern and was\\ndivided along the lines of a 60-to-40 split, with both States having \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree\\nand unrestricted use of the water of this subbasin within their respec-\\ntive states, subject, however, to the limitation that Oklahoma shall\\nallow a quantity of water equal to the 40 percent of the total runoff\\noriginating below the following existing, authorized or proposed last\\nmajor downstream damsites in Oklahoma to flow into Arkansas.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xc2\\xa75.03(b), id., at 23\\xe2\\x80\\x9324.\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 569 U.

See Dept.\\nof Commerce, Census Bureau, P. Mackun & S. Wilson,\\nPopulation Distribution and Change: 2000 to 2010 (Mar.\\n2011).

See generally\\nGalbraith, A Drought More Than Texas-Size, International\\nHerald Tribune, Oct. 3, 2011, p. 4.\\n  Against this backdrop, petitioner Tarrant, a Texas state\\nagency responsible for providing water to north-central\\nTexas (including the cities of Fort Worth, Arlington, and\\nMansfield), has endeavored to secure new sources of water\\nfor the area it serves. From 2000 to 2002, Tarrant, along\\nwith several other Texas water districts, offered to pur-\\nchase water from Oklahoma and the Choctaw and Chicka-\\nsaw Nations. See 2 App. 336\\xe2\\x80\\x93382. But these negotiations\\nwere unsuccessful and Tarrant eventually abandoned\\nthese efforts.\\n  Because Texas\\xe2\\x80\\x99 need for water only continued to grow,\\nTarrant settled on a new course of action.

Tarrant proposed to divert the Kiamichi River,\\nat a point located in subbasin 5 of Reach II, before it dis-\\ncharges into the Red River and, according to Tarrant, be-\\ncomes too saline for potable use.\\n  Tarrant knew, however, that Oklahoma would likely\\ndeny its permits because various state laws (collectively,\\nthe Oklahoma water statutes) effectively prevent out-of-\\nstate applicants from taking or diverting water from within\\nOklahoma\\xe2\\x80\\x99s borders. These statutes include a require-\\nment that the OWRB consider, when evaluating an appli-\\ncation to take water out of State, whether that water\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccould feasibly be transported to alleviate water short-\\nages in the State of Oklahoma.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Okla.

HERRMANN\\n\\n                          Opinion of the Court\\n\\n   In Tarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view, this provision essentially creates a\\nborderless common in which each of the four signatory\\nStates may cross each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boundaries to access a\\nshared pool of water. Tarrant reaches this interpretation\\nin two steps. First, it observes that \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cequal\\nrights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d language grants each State an equal entitlement to\\nthe waters of subbasin 5, subject to a 25 percent cap.\\nSecond, Tarrant argues \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s silence concerning\\nstate lines indicates that the Compact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drafters did not\\nintend to allocate water according to state borders in this\\nsection. According to Tarrant, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9825 percent\\xe2\\x80\\x99 language\\n[of \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)] makes clear that, in exercising its \\xe2\\x80\\x98equal\\nrights\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to the common pool of water, no State may take\\nmore than a one-quarter share,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Reply Brief 3, but any of\\nthe signatory States may \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccross state lines to obtain [its]\\nshar[e] of Subbasin 5 waters,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brief for Petitioner 32.\\n   The OWRB disputes this reading. In its view, the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cequal rights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d promised by \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1) afford each State an\\nequal opportunity to make use of the excess water within\\nsubbasin 5 of Reach II but only within each State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own\\nborders. This is because the OWRB reads \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsilence differently from Tarrant. The OWRB interprets\\nthat provision\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absence of language granting any cross-\\nborder rights to indicate that the Compact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drafters had\\nno intention to create any such rights in the signatory\\nStates.\\n   Unraveling the meaning of \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s silence with\\nrespect to state lines is the key to resolving whether the\\nCompact pre-empts the Oklahoma water statutes.8 If\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n  8 The Compact Clause of the Constitution provides that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[n]o State\\n\\nshall, without the Consent of Congress, . . . enter into any Agreement or\\nCompact with another State.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Art.

But if \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsilence instead reflects a background understanding on\\nthe part of the Compact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drafters that state borders were\\nto be respected within the Compact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s allocation, then the\\nOklahoma statutes do not conflict with the Compact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nallocation of water.\\n                                B\\n   Interstate compacts are construed as contracts under\\nthe principles of contract law. Texas v. New Mexico, 482\\nU. S. 124, 128 (1987). So, as with any contract, we begin\\nby examining the express terms of the Compact as the\\nbest indication of the intent of the parties, see also Mon-\\ntana v. Wyoming, 563 U.

For exam-\\nple, \\xc2\\xa75.03(b), which governs subbasin 3 of Reach II,\\nprovides that\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he States of Oklahoma and Arkansas shall have\\n     free and unrestricted use of the water of this subbasin\\n     within their respective states, subject, however, to the\\n     limitation that Oklahoma shall allow a quantity of\\n     water equal to . . . 40 percent of the total runoff origi-\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nSupremacy Clause, Art.

Thus, \\xc2\\xa75.03(b)\\nand \\xc2\\xa76.03(b) mimic \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1) in allocating water rights\\nwithin a subbasin, but differ in that they make explicit ref-\\nerence to water use \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwithin\\xe2\\x80\\x9d state boundaries. Relying on\\nthe expressio unius canon of construction, Tarrant finds\\nthat \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s silence regarding borders is significant\\nbecause \\xe2\\x80\\x9c \\xe2\\x80\\x98[w]here Congress includes particular language\\nin one section of a statute but omits it in another section of\\nthe same Act, it is generally presumed [that] Congress\\nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion\\nor exclusion.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Brief for Petitioner 29 (quoting Russello v.\\nUnited States, 464 U.

For\\nexample, \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(3), which governs the waters of subbasin\\n5 in Reach II when flows are below 1,000 CFS, requires\\nthat during such periods, Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma\\nallow water \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwithin their respective states to flow into the\\nRed River as required to maintain a 1,000 [CFS] flow at\\nthe Arkansas-Louisiana state boundary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 1 App. 25 (em-\\nphasis added). Obviously none of the upstream States can\\nredirect water that lies outside of their borders, so the\\nphrase \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwithin their respective states\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is superfluous in\\n\\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(3). In contrast, \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(2), which governs when\\nthe River\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flow at the Arkansas-Louisiana border is above\\n1,000 CFS but below 3,000 CFS, requires that upstream\\nStates allow a flow to Louisiana equivalent to 40 percent\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 569 U.

This language can only refer to\\nwater within each State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s borders because otherwise each\\nState would have to contribute 40 percent to the total\\nwater flow, which would add up to more than 100 percent.\\nRead together and to avoid absurd results, \\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(2)\\nand (3) suggest that each upstream State is individually\\nresponsible for ensuring that sufficient subbasin 5 water\\nlocated within its respective borders flows down to Louisi-\\nana, even though \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(2) lacks any explicit reference to\\nstate lines.\\n   Applying Tarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s understanding of \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s si-\\nlence regarding state lines to other of the Compact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s provi-\\nsions would produce further anomalous results. Consider\\n\\xc2\\xa76.01(b). That provision states that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTexas is apportioned\\nsixty (60) percent of the runoff of [subbasin 1 of Reach III]\\nand shall have unrestricted use thereof; Arkansas is enti-\\ntled to forty (40) percent of the runoff of this subbasin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nId., at 32.

We therefore turn to other interpretive tools to shed\\nlight on the intent of the Compact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drafters. See Okla-\\nhoma v. New Mexico, 501 U. S. 221, 235, n. 5 (1991).10\\nThree things persuade us that cross-border rights were\\nnot granted by the Compact: the well-established principle\\nthat States do not easily cede their sovereign powers,\\nincluding their control over waters within their own terri-\\ntories; the fact that other interstate water compacts have\\ntreated cross-border rights explicitly; and the parties\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\ncourse of dealing.\\n                             1\\n   The background notion that a State does not easily cede\\nits sovereignty has informed our interpretation of inter-\\nstate compacts.

We think that the\\nbetter understanding of \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s silence is that the\\nparties drafted the Compact with this legal background in\\nmind, and therefore did not intend to grant each other\\ncross-border rights under the Compact.\\n  In response, Tarrant contends that its interpretation\\nwould not intrude on any sovereign prerogative of Okla-\\nhoma because that State would retain its authority to\\nregulate the water within its borders. Because anyone\\nseeking water from Oklahoma would still have to apply to\\nthe OWRB, receive a permit, and abide by its conditions,\\nTarrant argues that Oklahoma\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sovereign authority\\nremains untouched by its interpretation. But Tarrant\\ncannot have it both ways. Adopting Tarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reading\\nwould necessarily entail assuming that Oklahoma and\\nthree other States silently surrendered substantial control\\nover the water within their borders when they agreed to\\nthe Compact. Given the background principles we have\\ndescribed above, we find this unlikely to have been the\\nintent of the Compact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s signatories.\\n                              2\\n  Looking to the customary practices employed in other\\ninterstate compacts also helps us to ascertain the intent of\\nthe parties to this Compact.

HERRMANN\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\ncants from Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana could all apply\\nto the OWRB for permits to take water from Oklahoma.\\nThe OWRB would then be obligated to determine the total\\namount of water in Oklahoma beyond the 25 percent cap\\ncreated in \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1), given that the Compact would only\\nobligate Oklahoma to deliver water beyond its quarter\\nshare. This alone would be a herculean task because the\\nCompact does not require ongoing monitoring or account-\\ning, see Compact \\xc2\\xa72.11, 1 App. 13, and not all of the water\\nin subbasin 5 is located or originates in Oklahoma. More-\\nover, the OWRB would be tasked with determining the\\npriority under the Compact of applicants from other\\nStates. This would almost certainly require the OWRB to\\nnot only determine whether Oklahoma had received more\\nor less than its 25 percent allotment, but whether other\\nStates had as well. Put plainly, the end result would be\\na jurisdictional and administrative quagmire. The pro-\\nvisions in the other interstate water compacts resolve\\nthese complications. The absence of comparable provisions\\nin the Red River Compact strongly suggests that cross-\\nborder rights were never intended to be part of the States\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nagreement.\\n  Tarrant counters that not all interstate compacts that\\npermit cross-border diversions have explicit language to\\nthis effect. On this front, Tarrant manages to identify one\\ninterstate compact that it contends permits cross-border\\ndiversions without express language to that effect, the\\nUpper Niobrara River Compact, Pub. L. 91\\xe2\\x80\\x9352, 83 Stat.\\n86. Tarrant observes that this compact, which deals with\\na river mostly located in Nebraska with only a small\\nportion in Wyoming, provides that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]here shall be no\\nrestrictions on the use of the surface waters of [the river]\\nby Wyoming.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See Art. V(A)1, id., at 88. Tarrant suggests\\nthat this language, coupled with the fact that the bulk of\\nthe river is in Nebraska, implicitly indicates that the\\ncompact grants Wyoming a right to enter Nebraska and\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 569 U.

First, we are not convinced that a\\nsingle compact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to reference state borders does\\nmuch to detract from the overall custom in this area. See\\nsupra, at 16\\xe2\\x80\\x9318, and n. 12. Second, the Upper Niobrara\\nRiver Compact is not a helpful counterexample for Tar-\\nrant. The general provision that Tarrant quotes is paired\\nwith a host of detailed conditions. See Arts. V(A)1(a)\\xe2\\x80\\x93(f),\\n83 Stat. 88. Contrary to Tarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position, then, assum-\\ning that the Upper Niobrara River compact does create\\nany cross-border rights, it does so not through silence, but\\nthrough the detailed scheme that would apply to any such\\ncontemplated diversions.\\n   Tarrant also argues that \\xc2\\xa72.05(d) of the Red River Com-\\npact, which provides that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[e]ach Signatory State shall\\nhave the right to\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[u]se the bed and banks of the Red\\nRiver and its tributaries to convey stored water, imported\\nor exported water, and water apportioned according to this\\nCompact,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 1 App. 11, in fact authorizes cross-border diver-\\nsions. Because the present border between Texas and\\nOklahoma east of the Texas Panhandle is set by the vege-\\ntation line on the south bank of the River, Red River\\nBoundary Compact, 114 Stat. 919, Tarrant contends that\\n\\xc2\\xa72.05(d) reflects an understanding on the part of the Com-\\npact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s drafters that state borders could be crossed. But the\\nissue is not as simple as Tarrant makes it out to be. When\\nthe Compact was drafted, the Texas-Oklahoma border was\\nfixed at the south bank of the River. See Texas v. Okla-\\nhoma, 457 U. S. 172 (1982). If Texas was able to access\\nwater through the south bank of the River\\xe2\\x80\\x94an issue left\\nunbriefed by the parties\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Compact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s framers may\\nhave believed that Texas could reach the River and take\\nwater from it without having to enter Oklahoman land,\\ncasting doubt on Tarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theory. In any event, even if\\n\\xc2\\xa72.05(d) is read to establish a cross-border right, it does so\\nthrough express language setting forth the location and\\npurposes under which such an incursion is permissible.\\n\\x0c20    TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v.

A \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpart[y\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] course of perfor-\\nmance under the Compact is highly significant\\xe2\\x80\\x9d evidence\\nof its understanding of the compact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terms. Alabama v.\\nNorth Carolina, 560 U. S., at___ (slip op., at 14).

Brief for\\nRespondents 26, 49\\xe2\\x80\\x9351. Indeed, Tarrant attempted to\\npurchase water from Oklahoma over the course of 2000\\nuntil 2002, see supra, at 7, a strange offer if Tarrant be-\\nlieved it was entitled to demand such water without pay-\\nment under the Compact.\\n   In response, Tarrant maintains that there were \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompel-\\nling business reasons\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for it to purchase water. Reply\\nBrief 17. We are unpersuaded.

See 2\\nApp. 362\\xe2\\x80\\x93363 (summarizing Texas purchase proposal).\\nYet there is no indication that Tarrant or any other Texas\\nagency or the State of Texas itself previously made any\\nmention of cross-border rights within the Compact, and\\nnone of the other signatory States has ever made such a\\nclaim.\\n                            4\\n  The Compact creates no cross-border rights in Texas.\\nTarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remaining arguments do not persuade us\\notherwise.\\n  First, Tarrant argues that its interpretation of the\\nCompact is necessary to realize the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstructure and purpose\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 569 U.

Tarrant contends\\nthat because the boundary of subbasin 5 is set by the\\nlocation of the last existing, authorized, or proposed sites\\nfor a downstream dam before the Red River, see Compact\\n\\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa75.01(a), 5.02(a), 5.03(b), 5.04(a), 1 App. 22\\xe2\\x80\\x9324, the Com-\\npact allows each of the States upstream from Louisiana to\\nprevent water from flowing from its tributaries into sub-\\nbasin 5. Tarrant reasons that each State will therefore\\nhold whatever water it needs in its upstream basins.\\nGiven this, Tarrant maintains that any water that a State\\nvoluntarily allows to reach subbasin 5 must be surplus\\nwater that State did not intend to use, and if the upstream\\nState has no need for that water, then there is no reason\\nnot to allow other States to access and use it, even across\\nborders.\\n   This argument is founded on a shaky premise: It as-\\nsumes that flows from these dammed-up tributaries are\\nthe sole source of water in subbasin 5. But \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)\\nexplains that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[s]ignatory States shall have equal rights to\\nthe use of runoff originating in subbasin 5,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as well as\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwater flowing into subbasin 5,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which would include flows\\nfrom the main stem of the River itself. Id., at 25. Thus,\\nthere are waters that are specific to subbasin 5 separate\\nfrom those originating in the tributaries covered by sub-\\nbasins 1 through 4. Tarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account of the purposes of\\nsubbasin 5 does not explain how these waters were to be\\nallocated.\\n   Tarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second argument regarding the purposes of\\nReach II is that \\xc2\\xa75.05(b)(1)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 25 percent cap on each State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\naccess to excess water in subbasin 5 should be read to\\nimply that if a State cannot access sufficient water within\\nits borders to meet its share under the cap, then it must be\\nable to cross borders to reach that water. Were it other-\\nwise, Tarrant explains, the 25 percent cap would have no\\npurpose. To support this argument, Tarrant draws on a\\n1970 engineering report that it contends shows that only\\n\\x0c22    TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\\n\\n                    Opinion of the Court\\n\\n16 percent of the freshwater flowing into subbasin 5 was\\nlocated in Texas. Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 5. The OWRB\\nchallenges this percentage with its own calculations\\ndrawn from the report, and asserts that Texas had access\\nto at least 29 percent of the excess water in subbasin 5\\nwithin its own borders. Brief for Respondents 26, 47\\xe2\\x80\\x9348,\\nand n. 17.\\n  Fortunately, we need not delve into calculations based\\non a decades-old engineering report to resolve this argu-\\nment. As we have explained, supra, at 4\\xe2\\x80\\x936, Texas does not\\nhave a minimum guarantee of 25 percent of the excess\\nwater in subbasin 5. If it believes that Oklahoma is using\\nmore than its 25 percent allotment and wishes to stop it\\nfrom doing so, then it may call for an accounting under\\n\\xc2\\xa72.11 of the Compact and, depending on the results of that\\naccounting, insist that Oklahoma desist from taking more\\nthan its provided share. See Compact \\xc2\\xa72.11, and Com-\\nment on Art. II, 1 App. 13\\xe2\\x80\\x9316. This is the appropriate\\nremedy provided under the Compact. But Texas has never\\ndone so and Tarrant offers no evidence that in the present\\nday Texas cannot access its 25 percent share on its own\\nland.\\n                             C\\n  Under the Compact\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terms, water located within Okla-\\nhoma\\xe2\\x80\\x99s portion of subbasin 5 of Reach II remains under\\nOklahoma\\xe2\\x80\\x99s control. Accordingly, Tarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theory that\\nOklahoma\\xe2\\x80\\x99s water statutes are pre-empted because they\\nprevent Texas from exercising its rights under the Com-\\npact must fail for the reason that the Compact does not\\ncreate any cross-border rights in signatory States.\\n                          III\\n  Tarrant also challenges the constitutionality of the\\nOklahoma water statutes under a dormant Commerce\\nClause theory.

So, Tarrant continues, because Oklahoma\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nlaws prevent this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunallocated water\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from being distrib-\\nuted out of State, those laws violate the Commerce Clause.\\n   Tarrant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assumption that that the Compact leaves\\nsome water \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunallocated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is incorrect. The interpretive\\ncomment for Article V of the Compact makes clear that\\nwhen the River\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flow is above 3,000 CFS, \\xe2\\x80\\x9call states are\\nfree to use whatever amount of water they can put to\\nbeneficial use,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d subject to the requirement that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]f the\\nstates have competing uses and the amount of water\\navailable in excess of 3000 CFS cannot satisfy all such\\nuses, each state will honor the other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to 25% of the\\nexcess flow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 1 App. 29\\xe2\\x80\\x9330. If more than 25 percent of\\nsubbasin 5\\xe2\\x80\\x99s water is located in Oklahoma, that water is\\nnot \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunallocated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; rather, it is allocated to Oklahoma\\nunless and until another State calls for an accounting\\nand Oklahoma is asked to refrain from utilizing more than\\nits entitled share.13 The Oklahoma water statutes can-\\nnot discriminate against interstate commerce with re-\\nspect to unallocated waters because the Compact leaves no\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n  13 Moreover, even if Oklahoma utilized less than 25 percent of the\\n\\nexcess subbasin 5 water within its territory and allowed the rest to flow\\ndown the River, that water would pass from Reach II into Reach V, see\\nCompact \\xc2\\xa72.12, 1 App. 13, the waters of which are completely allocated\\nto Louisiana, \\xc2\\xa78.01, id., at 38. Again, no water is left \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunallocated.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\x0c24     TARRANT REGIONAL WATER DIST. v. HERRMANN\\n\\n                      Opinion of the Court\\n\\nwaters unallocated.

In reviewing discharges, the Board presumes regularity in the conduct of governmental affairs unless there is substantial credible evidence to rebut the presumption, to include evidence submitted by the Applicant.  The Board completed a thorough review of the circumstances that led to the discharge and the discharge process to ensure the pertinent standards of equity and propriety were met.  \\n\\nThe Applicant\\'s record of service included:\\n\\n  for  of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ): \\n\\tArticle 92 (Failure to obey order, regulation)  3 specifications\\n\\n\\nBased on the  committed by the Applicant, the command administratively processed the Applicant for separation.  The NDRB did not have the Applicant\\'s administrative separation package to determine whether or not the Applicant waived their rights to consult with a qualified counsel, submit a written statement, and request an Administrative Separation Board.  A separation code of HKQ1 on the Applicant\\'s DD 214 indicates that an Administrative Separation Board was waived.\\n\\nIssue 1:  The Applicant requests a change to his character of service, narrative reason for separation and reentry code in order to reenlist in the USMC.  Effective 6 February 2015, the NDRB is authorized to change a NDRB Applicant\\'s Reenlistment Code if related to an accompanying change in discharge characterization or narrative, but this authority is strictly limited to those cases where an applicant\\'s narrative reason or characterization of discharge is changed and that change warrants revision of the previously issued reenlistment code.  Additionally, the NDRB has no authority to upgrade a discharge for the sole purpose of enhancing reenlistment opportunities.  An unfavorable \"RE-CODE\" is, in itself, not a bar to reenlistment.  A request for a waiver can be submitted during the processing of a formal application for reenlistment through a recruiter.\\n\\nIssue 2:\\tThe Applicant requests a change to his type of separation contending that the current one listed is incorrect.  The Applicant contends that per the MARCORSEPMAN (MCO 1600.16), paragraph 1003, that \"Discharged\" is not an appropriate type of separation and that \"General Discharge\" is the official verbiage.  Appendix B \"Detailed Instructions for DD Forms 214, 214WS, 214C, and 214\" of the MARCORPSEPMAN, paragraph B001.23a.  lists \"Discharged\" and does not list \"General Discharge\" as a type of separation that should be entered on the DD Form 214.  The Applicant would like his type of discharge changed to \"Released from Active Duty\" because although his command wanted discharge him, he did not want to go and he believes that he was let go or \"released\" by his command.  Despite the Applicant\\'s contention, the record shows that the Applicant was discharged and \"discharged\" is accurate as the type of separation the Applicant received.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIssue 3:\\tThe Applicant contends that his command did not support him in his request to take care of his personal problems to include divorce and that this contributed to his disciplinary problems.  The Applicant contends the characterization of his discharge should be upgraded because he suffered a lot of setbacks due to family issues.  The NDRB recognizes that serving in the military is challenging.  Most servicemembers, however, serve honorably and therefore earn their Honorable discharges.  In fairness to those Marines and Sailors who served honorably, Commanders and Separation Authorities are tasked to ensure that undeserving servicemembers receive no higher characterization than is due.   Although the Applicant states that he went to the chaplain to discuss his need for taking time off to take care of his marital issues, and the chaplain addressed this to his command, refusing to perform ones duties on three separate occasions in violation of UCMJ Article 92 was not justified.  The NDRB determined the Applicant\\'s personal problems were not mitigating factors in his misconduct.  Relief denied.\\n\\nIssue 4:  The Applicant requests a change to his reentry code contending that his separation was based on a unique, isolated incident that does not reflect previous service record history.  Despite a servicemember\\'s prior record of service, certain serious offenses, even though isolated, warrant separation from the Naval Service to maintain proper order and discipline.  This usually results in an unfavorable characterization of discharge or, at a maximum, a punitive discharge and possible confinement if adjudicated and awarded as part of a sentence by a special or general court-martial.  The Applicant was found guilty of violation of UCMJ Article 92 (three specifications).  However, his command did not pursue a punitive discharge but opted instead for the more lenient administrative discharge.  The NDRB found the characterization of the Applicant\\'s discharge was equitable and consistent with the characterization of discharge given others in similar circumstances.  Relief denied.\\n\\nIssue 5:  The Applicant requests a change to his narrative reason for separation contending that the current entry is inaccurate of the actual events and unjust because of the swift negative posture the command took.  The NDRB was unable to review the Applicant\\'s discharge package, as it was not included in his official service record.  The NDRB presumed regularity in governmental affairs in that the Separation Authority and Staff Judge Advocate review of the discharge package ensured that the Applicant was afforded all of his administrative rights pursuant to the separation process.  The Applicant\\'s separation code on his DD Form 214 indicates that he waived his right to an Administrative Separation Board.   If the Applicant felt that his discharge was unjust, it was his obligation to contest those charges at the time they were made.  During an administrative separation board, he would have had the opportunity to mount a defense against the charges.  The Applicant submitted insufficient evidence to support his contention that his narrative reason for separation is inaccurate and unjust, therefore, the NDRB must rely upon the presumption of regularity in the conduct of Government affairs.  Relief denied.\\n\\n \\n                                   Decision\\n\\nAfter a thorough review of the available evidence, to include the Applicant\\'s issues, summary of service,  record entries, and discharge process, the Board found  at the time of discharge.  Therefore, the awarded characterization of service shall  GENERAL (UNDER HONORABLE CONDITIONS), the narrative reason for separation shall  MISCONDUCT with a corresponding separation code of HKQ1, and the reentry code shall  RE-4.  The Applicant remains eligible for a personal appearance hearing for a period of fifteen years from the date of the discharge.  The Applicant is directed to the Addendum for additional information.\\n                   ADDENDUM:  Information for the Applicant\\n\\nComplaint Procedures: If you believe the decision in your case is unclear, not responsive to the issues you raised, or does not otherwise comport with the decisional document requirements of DoD Instruction 1332.28, you may submit a complaint in accordance with Enclosure (5) of that Instruction to the Joint Service Review Activity, OUSD (P&R) PI-LP, The Pentagon, Washington, DC  20301-4000.  You should read Enclosure (5) of the Instruction before submitting such a complaint.  The complaint procedure does not permit a challenge of the merits of the decision; it is designed solely to ensure that the decisional documents meet applicable requirements for clarity and responsiveness.  You may view DoD Instruction 1332.28 and other Decisional Documents by going online at http://boards.law.af.mil/.  More information is available at http://www.secnav.navy.mil/mra/CORB/pages/ndrb/default.aspx.\\n\\nAdditional Reviews: After a document review has been conducted, former members are eligible for a personal appearance or telephonic hearing, provided the application is received at the NDRB within 15 years of the Applicant\\'s date of discharge.  The Applicant can provide documentation to support any claims of post-service accomplishments or any additional evidence related to this discharge.  Representation at a personal appearance hearing is recommended but not required.  There are veterans organizations such as the American Legion and the Disabled American Veterans that are willing to provide guidance to former service members in their efforts to obtain a discharge upgrade.  If a former member has been discharged for more than 15 years, has already been granted a personal appearance hearing or has otherwise exhausted their opportunities before the NDRB, the Applicant may petition the Board for Correction of Naval Records (BCNR), 701 South Courthouse Road, Suite 1001, Arlington, VA 22204-2490, or http://www.secnav.navy.mil/mra/bcnr/Pages/default.aspx for further review.\\n\\nService Benefits: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) determines eligibility for post-service benefits, not the NDRB.  There is no requirement or law that grants recharacterization solely on the issue of obtaining veterans benefits and this issue does not serve to provide a foundation upon which the Board can grant relief.\\n\\nEmployment/Educational Opportunities: The NDRB has no authority to upgrade a discharge for the sole purpose of enhancing employment or educational opportunities.  Regulations limit the NDRB\\'s review to a determination of the propriety and equity of the discharge.\\n\\nReenlistment/RE-code: Effective 6 February 2015, the NDRB is authorized to change a NDRB Applicant\\'s Reenlistment Code if related to an accompanying change in discharge characterization or narrative, but this authority is strictly limited to those cases where an applicant\\'s narrative reason or characterization of discharge is changed and that change warrants revision of the previously issued reenlistment code.  Additionally, the NDRB has no authority to upgrade a discharge for the sole purpose of enhancing reenlistment opportunities.  An unfavorable \"RE-CODE\" is, in itself, not a bar to reenlistment.  A request for a waiver can be submitted during the processing of a formal application for reenlistment through a recruiter.\\n\\nMedical Conditions and Misconduct: DoD disability regulations do not preclude a disciplinary separation.  Appropriate regulations stipulate that separations for misconduct take precedence over potential separations for other reasons.  Whenever a member is being processed through the Physical Evaluation Board, and is processed subsequently for an administrative involuntary separation or is referred to a court martial for misconduct, the disability evaluation is suspended pending the outcome of the non-disability proceedings.  If the action includes either a punitive or administrative discharge for misconduct or for any basis wherein an Other Than Honorable discharge is authorized, the medical board report is filed in the member\\'s terminated health record.  Additionally, the NDRB does not have the authority to change a narrative reason for separation to one indicating a medical disability or other medical related reasons.  Only the BCNR can grant this type of narrative reason change.\\n\\nAutomatic Upgrades: There is no law or regulation that provides for an unfavorable discharge to be upgraded based solely on the passage of time or good conduct subsequent to leaving naval service.\\n\\nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder and/or Traumatic Brain Injury: For all claims involving PTSD and/or TBI, the NDRB\\'s review implemented the guidance set forth in the SECDEF Memorandum of 3 September 2014 (Supplemental guidance to Military Boards for Correction of Military/Naval Records Considering Discharge Upgrade Requests by Veterans Claiming Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).  In accordance with U.S. Code, Title X, Section 1553 (d)(1) & d(2), the NDRB included a member who is a physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist and accorded the case sufficient priority to achieve an expedited resolution and a final decision.\\n\\n Post-Service Conduct: The NDRB is authorized to consider post-service factors in the recharacterization of a discharge.  Outstanding post-service conduct, to the extent such matters provide a basis for a more thorough understanding of the Applicant\\'s performance and conduct during the period of service under review, is considered during Board reviews.  Documentation to support a post-service conduct upgrade includes, but is not limited to: a verifiable continuous employment record; marriage and children\\'s birth certificates (if applicable); character witness statements; documentation of community or church service; certification of non-involvement with civil authorities; evidence of financial stability or letters of good standing from banks, credit card companies, or other financial institutions; attendance at or completion of higher education (official transcripts); and documentation of a drug-free lifestyle.   The Applicant is advised that completion of these items alone does not guarantee the upgrade of an unfavorable discharge, as each discharge is reviewed by the Board on a case-by-case basis to determine if post-service accomplishments help demonstrate  in-service misconduct was an aberration and not indicative of the member\\'s overall character.\\n\\nIssues Concerning Bad-Conduct Discharges (BCD): Because relevant and material facts stated in a court-martial specification are presumed by the NDRB to be established facts, issues relating to the Applicant\\'s innocence of charges for which he was found guilty cannot form a basis for relief.  With respect to a discharge adjudged by a special court-martial, the action of the NDRB is restricted to upgrades based on clemency.  Clemency is an act of leniency that reduces the severity of the punishment imposed.  The NDRB does not have the jurisdictional authority to review a discharge or dismissal resulting from a general court-martial.\\n\\nBoard Membership: The names and votes of the members of the NDRB Board are recorded on the original of this document and may be obtained from the service records by writing to: Secretary of the Navy Council of Review Boards, Attn: Naval Discharge Review Board, 720 Kennon Street SE Rm 309, Washington Navy Yard DC  20374-5023.\\n\\nMilitary Sexual Trauma: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) uses the term \"military sexual trauma\" (MST) to refer to experiences of sexual assault or repeated, threatening sexual harassment experienced while on federal active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training.

We notice those which seem to be substantial. It is alleged, first, that there was error in refusing to transfer the law action to the equity docket. This was an action at law, brought by certain mortgagees to recover the value of goods mortgaged to them, which had been seized, sold, and appropriated by the defendant, the United States marshal, to other purposes. Nothing is plainer than that such an action is one at law. It is urged that the debts secured by the chattel mortgage were also secured by a real-estate mortgage; that the real estate thus conveyed had been sold, and the proceeds applied in reduction of the debts; that, therefore, an accounting was necessary to show the amount still due to the various creditors, and that such an accounting could only be had in an equitable action. The ruling of the circuit court was unquestionably correct. The recovery of the plaintiffs, the chattel mortgagees, was limited to the amount of the debts secured by the chattel mortgage. If any portion of the debts thus secured had been paid subsequently to the mortgage by the voluntary act of the debtor or the appropriation of the proceeds of other securities, this was matter of defense which could be pleaded and proved in an action at law as fully and satisfactorily as in a suit in equity. It was simply a question as to the partial payment of indebtedness. How it was made was immaterial; the fact and amount were the substantial matters; and these were matters provable and determinable in an action at law. There was no error, therefore, in refusing to transfer the case from the law to the equity docket.</p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second proposition is that the chattel mortgage, so called, was not in fact a chattel mortgage, but an assignment for the benefit of creditors; and therefore void under the statute of Texas, as giving preferences, and not being for the equal benefit of all creditors. But the instrument is in form and expressed intent and scope a mortgage. It recites that the grantor is indebted to sundry parties, naming them, and giving the amounts of the debts; that he is desirous of securing such creditors, and in consideration of the premises conveys to three of the creditors named the property, with instructions to take possession and sell, and, after paying expenses, to apply the proceeds to the payment, ratably, of the debts, and the balance, if any, to return to the grantor. It then reads: \\'This instrument is intended as a chattel mortgage to secure the debts herein mentioned;\\' and states that it is made to the three creditors mentioned, in behalf of themselves and the other creditors named, because on account of the great number of the latter it would be inconvenient for them all to act in its execution. It is true that there is no expressed condition of defeasance, but that attaches to every conveyance made simply or security, and it is unnecessary to state that which the law implies. That it contained a direction for the mortgagees to sell is not material, for, in the absence of such a direction, a mortgagee, on taking possession, should sell and apply the proceeds to the satisfaction of his debt. Instruments similar in form have been rpea tedly presented to the consideration of the supreme court of Texas, and adjudged to be chattel mortgages, and not within the scope of the act of March 24, 1879, providing for assignments for the benefit of creditors, or in conflict with the eighteenth section of that act, which forbids preferences in assignments.

Nor can any advantage be taken by the plaintiffs in error of the opinion expressed by the trial court, when the instrument was offered in evidence, that its validity depended entirely on the fact as to whether, when it was made the grantor was insolvent or contemplated insolvency, and this irrespective of whether that opinion was correct or not, for the verdict of the jury in favor of the plaintiffs negatives the existence of such conditions if their existence avoided the instrument.</p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the law was fully given by the court to the jury we are bound to presume, in the absence from the record of the entire charge; and that it was correctly stated from the fact that plaintiffs in error took no exceptions to it. True, the record contains four special instructions given by the court, and two asked by the defendants and refused. It also shows that two days after the verdict, and in their motion for a new trial, the defendants protested and excepted to such giving and refusal; but no where is it stated that these four instructions were all that were given, and in the federal courts a motion for a new trial is a mere application to the discretion of the trial court, and it is too late then to tender to the first time exceptions to rulings made at the trial. Express Co. v. Malin, 132 U. S. 531, 538, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 166. So, although one of the instructions asked by the defendants, and refused, relates to the effect on the instrument of the insolvency of the grantor therein, it may have been refused because already fully given in the general charge. For these reasons there is nothing in respect to the instructions, either those given or refused, which can now be considered.</p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another error alleged is that the court permitted H. D. McDonald, one of the counsel for plaintiffs, to testify that he was present at the time of the execution of the chattel mortgage, and to state what transpired at that time. The parties present at that interview were the mortgagor and certain of the creditors, and the interview was held with a view of obtaining from the mortgagor the security which was in fact given. McDonald was present both as a creditor and as attorney for the creditors. It is objected that communications to an attorney are confidential, and that he can neither be compelled nor permitted to disclose them as a witness; but the creditors whose counsel he was did not object to his testimony, and, as stated, he was present both as party and counsel. Under these circumstances, we see no error in the admission of his testimony. These are the substantial matters presented for our consideration, and in them we find no error. The judgment, therefore, will be affirmed.</p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\"footer\">\\n      <p>CC\\xe2\\x88\\x85 | Transformed by Public.Resource.Org</p>\\n    </div>\\n  \\n</div>",

Henrichsen argued the cause and filed the briefs \\nfor appellee/cross-appellant.\\n\\n     Before:  Edwards, Chief Judge, Sentelle and Randolph, \\nCircuit Judges.\\n\\n     Opinion for the Court filed by Chief Judge Edwards.\\n\\n     Edwards, Chief Judge:  This case involves a claim under an \\nindemnity agreement by a surety company, appellee Interna-\\ntional Fidelity Insurance Co. (\"IFIC\" or \"surety\"), against \\nthe holders of a payment bond, appellants Ideal Electronic \\nSecurity Co., Inc., et al. (\"Ideal\").  Upon securing the pay-\\nment bond, Ideal agreed to indemnify IFIC against any \\nlosses or expenses, including attorney\\'s fees incurred to de-\\nfend against claims arising under the bond.  In this case, \\nIFIC seeks recovery of attorney\\'s fees incurred by the surety \\nin defending a claim brought by Modern Electric, Inc. (\"Mod-\\nern\") against appellants for an alleged underpayment on \\nsubcontracted work.  The appellants claim (1) that because \\nthe surety failed to justify the hiring of counsel, no attorney\\'s \\nfees should be awarded and (2) that even if a claim for \\nattorney\\'s fees is warranted, the surety failed to demonstrate \\nthat the amount sought in this case is reasonable.\\n\\n     The District Court found that IFIC is entitled to fees for \\nits defense of appellants on the claim brought by Modern;  \\nhowever, because IFIC asserted that certain billing state-\\nments supporting the claim for fees were protected by the \\nattorney-client privilege (and redacted portions of some bill-\\ning statements), the District Court reduced the award of fees \\nfor the amounts covered by the purportedly privileged mate-\\nrials.  Ideal contends that it was entitled to review all billing \\nstatements, so that it would be in a position to show that the \\nsurety\\'s arrangements with counsel were both unnecessary \\nand unreasonable.  The surety cross-appeals, claiming that \\nthe District Court erred in reducing the award of attorney\\'s \\nfees by the amounts covered by privileged documents.\\n\\n     The contract claims arising under the disputed indemnity \\nagreement are governed by the law of the District of Colum-\\nbia.  Under D.C. law, once a party\\'s contractual entitlement \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nto attorney\\'s fees has been ascertained, it is within the trial \\ncourt\\'s sound discretion to determine a reasonable fee award.  \\nIn the instant case, we find that the District Court was \\ncorrect in holding that the surety was entitled to claim \\nattorney\\'s fees, but abused its discretion in assessing the \\namount due to IFIC.\\n\\n     Appellants are entitled to full discovery of information \\nunderlying the claim for fees;  only after obtaining such \\ndiscovery will the appellants be in a position to assess the \\nreasonableness of IFIC\\'s position and then present to the \\ncourt any legitimate challenges to the surety\\'s claim.  The \\nreasonableness of any portion of the billing statements can \\nonly be determined by examining all billing statements per-\\ntaining to the legal services provided as a whole.  Appellee \\neffectively waived its attorney-client privilege with regard to \\nall communications going to the reasonableness of the fees \\nclaimed when it placed the purportedly privileged matters in \\ndispute by claiming indemnification for the attorney\\'s fees.  \\nAccordingly, we remand the case to allow appellants an \\nopportunity to challenge the reasonableness of IFIC\\'s claim \\nfor fees following full disclosure of the redacted portions of \\nthe billing statements.  If IFIC declines to disclose the \\nredacted portions of the billing statements, then the entire \\nclaim for fees must be denied by the District Court.\\n\\n                                I. Background\\n\\n\\n     The Miller Act requires payment bonding to assure pay-\\nments to subcontractors on construction work undertaken for \\nthe United States.  40 U.S.C. ss 270a-270f (1994).  Ideal and \\nits principals, Cora Williams and Kenneth Rogers, entered \\ninto a contract with the United States to replace or repair \\nelectrical transformers at the Walter Reed Army Medical \\nCenter in Washington, D.C.  Since the contract was of a type \\ngoverned by the Miller Act, Ideal was required to obtain a \\npayment bond to secure the contract.  IFIC provided bond-\\ning for the base year, July 29, 1991 to July 28, 1992.  In order \\nto induce IFIC to provide the payment bond, Ideal entered \\ninto an indemnity agreement in which it agreed, under certain \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nconditions, to indemnify IFIC against any losses or expenses \\narising from the payment bond, including attorney\\'s fees \\nincurred in defending against claims arising under the bond \\nand costs incurred in enforcing the terms of the indemnity \\nagreement itself.  See Agreements of Indemnity at p 2, re-\\nprinted in Appendix of Appellee/Cross-Appellant at 21, 25 \\n(hereinafter \"Indemnity Agreement\").\\n\\n     This litigation commenced when a subcontractor on the \\nWalter Reed project, Modern, sued both Ideal and IFIC, \\nclaiming that Ideal had underpaid Modern for subcontracted \\nwork.  Modern brought this suit in the United States District \\nCourt for the District of Maryland, invoking that court\\'s \\njurisdiction under the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. s 270b, which \\nprovides a federal cause of action for persons supplying labor \\nand materials on federal construction projects to collect pay-\\nment under the bonds required by 40 U.S.C. s 270a.  The \\nsuit was subsequently transferred to the District Court for \\nthe District of Columbia.\\n\\n     IFIC formally tendered its defense to Ideal, upon the \\ncondition that Ideal first deposit with IFIC cash or collateral \\nin the amount of $300,000 to cover its potential liability as \\nsurety, including its attorney\\'s fees.  See Memorandum Opin-\\nion at 4-5 (May 3, 1996) (hereinafter \"Mem. Op.\").  Ideal \\ndeclined to provide the requested reserve payment;  as a \\nconsequence, IFIC mounted its own defense against Modern\\'s \\nclaims.  Id. at 5.  After discovery proceedings and two hear-\\nings, the District Court granted IFIC\\'s motion for summary \\njudgment dismissing Modern\\'s claims against IFIC.  Id. at 5-\\n6.\\n\\n     IFIC asserted the indemnification claim at issue in this \\nappeal in a cross-claim against Ideal and a third-party com-\\nplaint against Ideal\\'s principals.  On October 13, 1995, the \\nDistrict Court denied a motion by IFIC for summary judg-\\nment on its indemnification claim.  A jury trial was held on \\nApril 25 and 26, 1996.  At the conclusion of the trial, the \\nDistrict Court granted IFIC\\'s motion for judgment as a \\nmatter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1).  See Mem. \\nOp.;  Order Awarding Attorney\\'s Fees (July 1, 1996).  In \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nsupporting its claim for attorney\\'s fees, IFIC submitted bill-\\ning statements from counsel.  However, over the objection of \\nIdeal, IFIC redacted portions of the billing statements, con-\\ntending that the undisclosed materials were protected by the \\nattorney-client privilege.  The District Court resolved this \\ndispute by awarding fees only for the unredacted portions of \\nthe billing statements.  Mem. Op. at 11-12.  Subsequently, \\nIFIC filed a motion for additional fees incurred in prosecut-\\ning the indemnity action.  The District Court summarily \\ndenied this motion, stating simply that \"the judgment already \\nawarded to IFIC is reasonable compensation for legal work \\nthat was necessary to protect IFIC\\'s position.\"  Order Deny-\\ning Additional Attorney\\'s Fees (July 18, 1996).\\n\\n     Ideal appeals the District Court\\'s judgment as a matter of \\nlaw on the question of liability and on the reasonableness of \\nthe amount of fees awarded.  IFIC cross-appeals the District \\nCourt\\'s denial of fees based on redacted billing statements \\nand also the court\\'s denial of fees incurred in prosecuting the \\nindemnity action.\\n\\n                                 II. Analysis\\n\\n\\nA. Choice of Law \\n\\n     Before turning to the merits of the parties\\' appeals, we \\nmust first determine which law governs the case.  This \\nappeal involves a state contract claim which is in federal court \\nunder supplemental jurisdiction.  The Miller Act provides a \\nfederal cause of action for subcontractors and suppliers on \\nconstruction projects governed by the Act to collect on pay-\\nment bonds required by the Act.  40 U.S.C. s 270b (1994);  \\nF.D. Rich Co. v. United States ex rel. Indus. Lumber Co., 417 \\nU.S. 116, 127 (1974).  Accordingly, Modern\\'s suit against \\nIdeal and IFIC was properly brought in federal district court \\nunder the court\\'s federal question jurisdiction.  Although \\ncontract claims between the various parties to a case brought \\nunder the Miller Act may be heard by the federal court \\nhearing the Miller Act claim, the appended contract claims \\nare governed by state, not federal, law.  See, e.g., United \\nStates ex rel. J.W. Briggs v. Grubb, 358 F.2d 508, 515 (9th \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nCir. 1966) (local law rather than federal law is applicable to \\ncross-complaint under a Miller Act bond);  Western Casualty \\n& Surety Co. v. Biggs, 217 F.2d 163, 165 (7th Cir. 1954) (suit \\nby surety against general contractors as principals on pay-\\nment bond was not an action under the Miller Act, since the \\nAct provides only for an action on the payment bond by one \\nwho has furnished labor and material and has not been paid).\\n\\n     When deciding state-law claims under diversity or supple-\\nmental jurisdiction, federal courts apply the choice-of-law \\nrules of the jurisdiction in which they sit.  See Lee v. Flint-\\nkote Co., 593 F.2d 1275, 1278-79 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 1979).  The \\nDistrict of Columbia has adopted the Restatement (Second) of \\nConflict of Laws s 188.  Finance America Corp. v. Moyler, \\n494 A.2d 926, 929 & n.7 (D.C. 1985).  Where, as here, the \\nparties to a contract have not specified which law governs \\ntheir agreement, the Restatement approach requires the \\ncourt to weigh various jurisdictions\\' contacts with the transac-\\ntion at issue and to determine which has the most substantial \\ninterest in the matter.  According to the record, IFIC is \\ndomiciled in New Jersey, Appellants Williams and Rogers are \\ndomiciled in Virginia, Ideal is domiciled in the District of \\nColumbia, the indemnity agreement was entered into in the \\nDistrict of Columbia, and the subject matter of the contract \\n(the bond) secures construction taking place in the District of \\nColumbia.  On balance, and in the absence of any arguments \\nby the parties to the contrary, we hold that interpretation of \\nthe indemnity agreement is controlled by D.C. law.\\n\\nB. Judgment as a Matter of Law in Favor of IFIC\\n\\n     We review de novo the District Court\\'s order granting \\nIFIC\\'s motion for judgment as a matter of law.  Hendry v. \\nPelland, 73 F.3d 397, 400 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  We can affirm the \\nDistrict Court\\'s judgment only if we find \"no legally sufficient \\nevidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for\" Ideal \\nunder applicable D.C. law, \"considering the evidence in the \\nlight most favorable to [Ideal] and making all reasonable \\ninferences in [its] favor.\"  Id. at 400;  Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1).\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n     Under D.C. law, contractual provisions providing for the \\nindemnification of attorney\\'s fees are generally enforceable in \\naccordance with the intentions of the contracting parties, \\nunless enforcement would be contrary to public policy.  Wis-\\nconsin Ave. Assocs. v. 2720 Wisconsin Ave. Coop. Ass\\'n, 441 \\nA.2d 956, 964-65 (D.C. 1982);  FDIC v. Bender, 1997 WL \\n582901, *3 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 23, 1997).  \"Whether an attorneys \\nfees award is available is a matter of contract interpretation \\nby the trial judge, unless there is an ambiguity that needs to \\nbe resolved to determine the intention of the parties.  In that \\ncase, the entitlement question must be resolved by the fact-\\nfinder.\"  Urban Masonry Corp. v. N&N Contractors, Inc., \\n676 A.2d 26, 33 (D.C. 1996) (citations omitted).\\n\\n     The parties\\' indemnity agreement provides a \"good faith\" \\nstandard for determining whether Ideal is obligated to indem-\\nnify IFIC for attorney\\'s fees:\\n\\n     the Surety shall be entitled to charge for any and all \\n     disbursements made by it in good faith in or about the \\n     matters herein contemplated by this Agreement under \\n     the belief that it is or was liable for the sums and \\n     amounts so disbursed, or that it was necessary or expedi-\\n     ent to make such disbursements, whether or not such \\n     liability, necessity or expediency existed;  and [ ] vouch-\\n     ers or other evidence of any such payments made by the \\n     Surety shall be prima facie evidence of the fact and \\n     amount of the liability to the Surety.\\n\\nIndemnity Agreement at p 2. However, the parties dispute \\nexactly what this good faith standard requires.  IFIC con-\\ntends that it is entitled to attorney\\'s fees absent any showing \\nof fraud or bad faith.  Brief of Appellee/Cross-Appellant at \\n12.  Ideal argues that the agreement\\'s good faith standard \\nrequires something more than the mere absence of fraud.  \\nRather, Ideal asserts that, in order to be entitled to indemni-\\nty for any resulting attorney\\'s fees under the parties\\' agree-\\nment, IFIC must show (1) that its decision to retain separate \\ncounsel to defend against Modern\\'s claims was reasonable \\nand (2) that the services rendered by counsel were reason-\\nable.  Brief of Appellants/Cross-Appellees at 7-8.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n     There is no clear precedent under District of Columbia law \\ndefining the scope of a contractual \"good faith\" standard of \\nthe sort at issue here.  However, courts in other jurisdictions \\nhave indicated that, as a general matter, a surety must show \\nsomething akin to reasonable necessity when seeking attor-\\nney\\'s fees under an indemnity agreement.  For example, the \\nFifth Circuit, applying Mississippi law, has held that\\n\\n     [A]n indemnity agreement is not a blank check;  it does \\n     not entitle the surety [ ] to reimbursement for legal fees \\n     which are unreasonable or unnecessary.  To hold other-\\n     wise would allow [a surety] to retain counsel and to \\n     charge attorneys\\' fees against the indemnitor even when \\n     the surety [ ] does not require a separate legal defense to \\n     protect its interests.  The indemnity contract cannot \\n     reasonably be construed as requiring the indemnitee to \\n     bear the cost of such redundant representation.\\n\\nJackson v. Hollowell, 685 F.2d 961, 966 (5th Cir. 1982).  See \\nalso Sentry Ins. Co. v. Davison Fuel & Dock Co., 396 N.E.2d \\n1071, 1074 (Ohio Ct. App. 1978) (rejecting all claims for \\nrecovery of fees under indemnity agreement\\'s good faith \\nstandard for services which were simultaneously being ren-\\ndered competently by the principal\\'s counsel);  Central Tow-\\ners Apts. v. Martin, 453 S.W.2d 789, 799-800 (Tenn. Ct. App. \\n1969) (probing the reasonableness and necessity of a surety\\'s \\nincurred attorney\\'s fees, given the identity of interests be-\\ntween principal and surety in the indemnity context).  But \\nsee Wilson & Co. v. Walsenburg Sand & Gravel Co., 779 P.2d \\n1386, 1387 (Colo. Ct. App. 1989) (interpreting plain meaning \\nof similar good faith standard in similar indemnity agreement \\nas limiting defenses against liability to bad faith or fraud).\\n\\n     In any case, we need not resolve the contract interpretation \\nissue because, even if the District of Columbia Court of \\nAppeals were to interpret the agreement\\'s good faith stan-\\ndard to require a showing of reasonableness, or if a jury were \\nto find that the good faith standard was intended by the \\nparties to include a showing of reasonableness, no reasonable \\nfact-finder could find that IFIC\\'s decision to hire counsel to \\ndefend against Modern\\'s suit was unreasonable under the \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nuncontested facts of this case.  Accordingly, we hold that \\njudgment in favor of IFIC is appropriate pursuant to Rule \\n50(a)(1) with regard to the liability question of whether Ideal \\nis required, under the parties\\' indemnity agreement, to in-\\ndemnify IFIC for attorneys\\' fees incurred by IFIC to defend \\nitself against Modern\\'s claims.\\n\\n     Ideal alleges that IFIC\\'s decision to mount its own defense \\nagainst Modern\\'s claims was unreasonable because Modern\\'s \\nclaims against IFIC were obviously without merit and, more-\\nover, Ideal had offered to defend IFIC against these claims.  \\nIn essence, Ideal contends that IFIC did not need to hire \\ncounsel to mount a defense against Modern\\'s claims because \\nit could have relied on Ideal to defend these claims, even \\nthough Ideal was unwilling or unable to meet IFIC\\'s demand \\nfor a reserve payment to cover IFIC\\'s alleged liability to \\nModern.\\n\\n     This court resolved a similar claim in Carroll v. National \\nSurety Co., 24 F.2d 268 (D.C. Cir. 1928).  In that case, as \\nhere, a construction contractor entered into an indemnity \\nagreement in order to induce a surety to provide a payment \\nbond for a construction project.  Id. at 269.  The relevant \\nlanguage in the indemnity agreement in Carroll was virtually \\nidentical to the relevant contract language at issue here.  Id. \\nat 269-70.  In Carroll, the surety was sued for payment \\nunder the bond.  The surety, believing that it had no defense \\nto the claims, settled the claims and then sought indemnifica-\\ntion for the settlement costs from the contractor pursuant to \\ntheir indemnity agreement.  Id.  The contractor disputed the \\nsurety\\'s indemnification claim, alleging, among other things, \\nthat the surety was mistaken in its belief that it had no \\ndefense to the subcontractors\\' claims and that, in fact, it had \\na complete defense.  Id. at 270.  The contractor further \\nargued that, since it had notified the surety that it was willing \\nand able to mount a complete defense to the subcontractors\\' \\nclaims, the surety\\'s settlement of the claims was voluntary \\nand thus the contractor should not be required to indemnify \\nthe settlement costs.  Id.  This court rejected the contrac-\\ntor\\'s arguments, holding that the contractor\\'s notification to \\nthe surety that it was ready to furnish a complete defense to \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nthe claims against the surety did not deprive the surety of the \\nright to compromise the claims where the indemnity agree-\\nment authorized such a compromise.  Under the parties\\' \\nindemnity agreement, the surety waived this right only on the \\ncondition that the contractor deposit with the surety satisfac-\\ntory collateral for the payment of any judgment which might \\nbe entered against it.  Since the contractor had not tendered \\nsuch a deposit, the surety had acted within its rights under \\nthe indemnity agreement to settle the claims brought against \\nit under the bond and to seek indemnity from its principal for \\nthe same.  Id. at 270-71.  Similarly, Ideal\\'s offer to mount a \\ncomplete defense to Modern\\'s claims against IFIC did not \\ndeprive IFIC of its right to mount its own defense against \\nthese claims and then look to Ideal to indemnify its litigation \\ncosts.\\n\\n     Ideal does not offer any persuasive arguments that IFIC\\'s \\ndecision to retain counsel to defend against Modern\\'s suit was \\nunreasonable.  Regardless of the purported strength or \\nweakness of Modern\\'s claims against IFIC, no reasonable \\nfact-finder could find that IFIC\\'s decision to hire separate \\ncounsel to defend against Modern\\'s claims was unreasonable, \\nin light of Ideal\\'s inability or unwillingness to post satisfacto-\\nry collateral to cover the amount for which Modern sought to \\nhold IFIC liable.\\n\\nC. Reasonableness of the Fee Award\\n\\n     Although it was not unreasonable for IFIC to retain coun-\\nsel to defend against Modern\\'s claims, that is not the end of \\nour inquiry.  The second question at issue concerns the \\nreasonableness of the fee amount claimed by IFIC.\\n\\n     The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has long held, \\nand this court has acknowledged, that once a contractual \\nentitlement to attorney\\'s fees has been ascertained, the deter-\\nmination of a reasonable fee award is for the trial court in \\nlight of the relevant circumstances.  Bender, 1997 WL 582901 \\nat *3 (applying D.C. law).  Where a claim for attorney\\'s fees \\narises from a private contract provision, such a claim does not \\nembody a right to trial by jury.  McGuire v. Russell Miller, \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nInc., 1 F.3d 1306, 1313-15 (2d Cir. 1993);  Kudon v. f.m.e. \\nCorp., 547 A.2d 976, 978-80 (D.C. 1988).  Rather, the reason-\\nableness of an attorney\\'s fees award is within the sound \\ndiscretion of the trial court and is reviewed only for abuse of \\ndiscretion.  Singer v. Shannon & Luchs Co., 779 F.2d 69, 70 \\n(D.C. Cir. 1985).\\n\\n     Even when attorney\\'s fees are stipulated in an agreement, \\nthe trial court may still inquire into the reasonableness of the \\nfees claimed under an indemnity agreement if those fees are \\nchallenged.  Columbia Plaza Corp. v. Security Nat\\'l Bank, \\n676 F.2d 780, 791 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (applying D.C. law).  A \\ncontractual provision stipulating how the amount of the attor-\\nney\\'s fees award shall be calculated \"creates a rebuttable \\npresumption that the stipulated amount is reasonable.\"  \\nBender, 1997 WL 582901 at *5.  However, if a stipulated fee \\nis properly challenged, \"the district court [is] obliged under \\nDistrict law to award only reasonable fees, with reasonable-\\nness a determination to be made by the judge.\"  Id. at *6.\\n\\n     IFIC points to two provisions of the parties\\' agreement \\nwhich, in its view, limits the standard of reasonableness.  \\nFirst, IFIC notes that the agreement provides that the surety \\nmay sometimes recover disbursements even when there is no \\nshowing of \"liability, necessity or expediency.\"  See Indemni-\\nty Agreement at p 2.  The parties\\' agreement allows charges \\nonly for \"disbursements made ... in good faith,\" however.  \\nId.  As for attorney\\'s fees (as distinguished from disburse-\\nments to settle claims), the parties agreed at oral argument \\nthat disbursements for attorney\\'s fees can only be found to be \\nin good faith if the legal work for which the charges are made \\nwas reasonable and necessary to the surety\\'s defense.  Al-\\nthough IFIC obviously has some discretion under the parties\\' \\nagreement to decide about the scope of the legal work for \\nwhich it contracts, any decisions to pay counsel must pass a \\ntest of reasonableness in order to be in good faith.  Indeed, if \\ngood faith in this context did not include reasonableness, the \\nindemnitee would have no incentive to police its attorneys\\' \\nactivities and charges, since it could simply dump any and all \\ncharges billed onto the indemnitor.  Such a result would \\nmake no sense.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n     Second, IFIC argues that the indemnity agreement\\'s provi-\\nsion that \"vouchers or other evidence of any payments made \\nby the Surety shall be prima facie evidence of the fact and \\namount of the liability to the Surety,\" Indemnity Agreement \\nat p 2, requires Ideal to indemnify it for the full amount of the \\nattorney billing statements submitted.  This argument fails \\nupon assertion, for the contract provision relied on by IFIC \\nsays only that \"vouchers\" shall be \"prima facie evidence of \\nthe fact and amount of liability to the Surety.\"  This confirms \\nthat something more than evidence of mere payment will be \\nrequired if a charge is challenged.  Thus, this provision is \\nhardly conclusive with regard to the amount of a reasonable \\nfee award, but rather simply shifts to Ideal the burden of \\nproving that the fees claimed are excessive.\\n\\n     IFIC\\'s redaction of portions of the billing statements with-\\nholds from Ideal information essential to Ideal\\'s efforts to \\nmeet this burden.  The District Court attempted to resolve \\nthis issue by awarding attorney\\'s fees only for the unredacted \\nportions of the billing statements.  This is not an adequate \\nsolution.  As a practical matter, the reasonableness of any \\nportion of the billing statement can only be determined by \\nexamining all billing statements pertaining to the legal ser-\\nvices provided as a whole.  The reasonableness of any one \\nentry on an attorney\\'s billing statement is likely to be in-\\nformed by other charges incurred for the same general \\nservice.  For example, the court needs to determine:  Has the \\nattorney over-charged for its services by expending a ridicu-\\nlous amount of total time on a simple research task?  Did the \\nwork undertaken encompass issues and tasks outside the \\nscope of the question being litigated?  Was each task under-\\ntaken a necessary and reasonable component of a reasonable \\nlitigation strategy?  In this case, the general service at issue \\nis IFIC\\'s defense against Modern\\'s claims and its related \\ncross-claim against Ideal.  Ideal has the right to challenge \\nwhether IFIC\\'s disbursements for attorney\\'s fees pertaining \\nto this general service as a whole were reasonable.\\n\\n     Ideal is entitled to discover the information it requires to \\nappraise the reasonableness of the amount of fees requested \\nby IFIC, including the nature and extent of the work done by \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nIFIC\\'s counsel on various phases of the case, so that it may \\npresent to the court any legitimate challenges to IFIC\\'s \\nclaim.  See National Ass\\'n of Concerned Veterans v. Secre-\\ntary of Defense, 675 F.2d 1319, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  IFIC \\nmay opt to withhold billing statements under a claim of \\nattorney-client privilege;  however, where IFIC\\'s assertion of \\na privilege results in the withholding of information necessary \\nto Ideal\\'s defense to IFIC\\'s claim against it, the privilege \\nmust give way to Ideal\\'s right to mount a defense.  Under \\nthe common-law doctrine of implied waiver, the attorney-\\nclient privilege is waived when the client places otherwise \\nprivileged matters in controversy.  See 6 James W. Moore, et \\nal., Moore\\'s Federal Practice s 26.49[5] (3d ed. 1997).  This \\ncourt explained the rationale underlying the implied waiver \\ndoctrine in In re Sealed Case, 676 F.2d 793 (D.C. Cir. 1982):\\n\\n     Implied waiver deals with an abuse of a privilege....  \\n     Where society has subordinated its interest in the search \\n     for truth in favor of allowing certain information to \\n     remain confidential, it need not allow that confidentiality \\n     to be used as a tool for manipulation of the truth-seeking \\n     process....  [A party asserting attorney-client privilege] \\n     cannot be allowed, after disclosing as much as he pleases, \\n     to withhold the remainder.\\n\\nId. at 807 (quotation omitted).  This is particularly true \\nwhere, as here, a party partially discloses the allegedly \\nprivileged information in support of its claim against another, \\nbut then asserts the privilege as a basis for withholding from \\nits opponent the remainder of the information which is neces-\\nsary to defend against the claim.  Accord United States v. \\nWestern Elec. Co., 132 F.R.D. 1, 3 (D.D.C. 1990) (where client \\nplaced counsel\\'s actions at issue, client was precluded from \\nasserting work-product privilege as to any documents that \\nundermined client\\'s position while at the same time producing \\nwork-product that supported position);  Byers v. Burleson, \\n100 F.R.D. 436, 440 (D.D.C. 1983) (attorney-client privilege \\nimpliedly waived where privileged information is necessary to \\nresolve precise issue which party asserting privilege interject-\\ned into the case);  Wender v. United Services Auto. Ass\\'n, 434 \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nA.2d 1372, 1374 (D.C. 1981) (by asserting its reliance on \\nadvice of counsel as a material element of its defense, party \\nwaived the attorney-client privilege with respect to all com-\\nmunications to or from counsel concerning the transaction).\\n\\n     By claiming indemnification of attorney\\'s fees from Ideal \\nand offering the billing statements as evidence of the same, \\nIFIC waived its attorney-client privilege with respect to the \\nredacted portions of the billing statements and any other \\ncommunications going to the reasonableness of the amount of \\nthe fee award.  See In re Sealed Case, 877 F.2d 976, 980-81 \\n(D.C. Cir. 1989) (\"[A] waiver of the privilege in an attorney-\\nclient communication extends to all other communications \\nrelating to the same subject matter.\") (quotations omitted).  \\nIf IFIC opts to claim indemnity for attorney\\'s fees from \\nIdeal, it must disclose the billing statements itemizing those \\nfees in its entirety, notwithstanding its claim that portions of \\nthe billing statements are privileged.  If IFIC\\'s claim of \\nattorney-client privilege would otherwise have been valid, the \\ninformation could perhaps be examined by Ideal under seal, \\nbut in camera review by the court alone is insufficient.  Thus, \\nalthough \"the nature and amount of proof necessary to deter-\\nmine reasonableness\" is included within the trial court\\'s scope \\nof discretion in determining a reasonable fee award, Bender, \\n1997 WL 582901 at *4, we hold that the District Court abused \\nthis discretion in failing to require IFIC to disclose the \\nunredacted portions of the billing statements.\\n\\n                               III. Conclusion\\n\\n\\n     We affirm the District Court\\'s judgment finding Ideal \\nliable, under the parties\\' indemnity agreement, for attorney\\'s \\nfees incurred by IFIC in defending against Modern\\'s claims, \\nbut reverse and remand for determination of a reasonable fee \\naward.  Although the reasonableness of the fee award is \\nultimately within the District Court\\'s discretion, Ideal must \\nfirst be allowed an opportunity to challenge the reasonable-\\nness of the fees following full disclosure of the billing state-\\nments.  If IFIC continues to withhold the information, then \\nits claim for attorney\\'s fees should be dismissed in its entire-\\nty.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\n     On remand, the fees denied by the District Court\\'s July 18, \\n1996 order should be considered together with the fees at \\nissue in the July 1, 1996 order, since all of these fees were \\nallegedly incurred in pursuit of the same case.  In addition, \\nthe court must provide reasons to justify its determination of \\na reasonable award so that a reviewing court can evaluate \\nwhether it acted within its discretion.  Singer, 779 F.2d at \\n70-71.  Computation of a reasonable attorney\\'s fee award \\nrequires more than simply a report of the number of hours \\nspent and the hourly rate.  It also requires the court\\'s \\nassessment of, among other things, the time and labor rea-\\nsonably required by the case, the skill demanded by the \\nnovelty or complexity of the issues, and the incentive effects \\non future cases.  Thus, for example, the court should exclude \\ncharges billed for services which were unnecessary to IFIC\\'s \\ndefense against Modern\\'s claims or its related indemnity \\nclaim.  See id. at 71 (district court must justify awarding fees \\nfor work on issues that appellants argue are ineligible for \\ncompensation).\\n\\nSo ordered.\\n\\n\\n",

Code \\xc2\\xa7 35-42-1-1, and sentenced to sixty-five years in prison. \\xc2\\xa0In this appeal he raises one issue: \\xc2\\xa0\"Was defense counsel ineffective in failing to ask the trial court for an immediate limiting instruction regarding an alleged accomplice and witness who was called by the State but who refused to testify?\" \\xc2\\xa0We answer in the negative.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para6\"><span class=\"span0\"></span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para7\"><span class=\"span2\">Statement of Facts</span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para6\"><span class=\"span0\"></span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para5\"><span class=\"span0\">Johnson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trial for the murder of Steven Strycker lasted four days. \\xc2\\xa0Johnson\\'s accomplice, Brandon Ennis, had earlier pled guilty to murder. \\xc2\\xa0The facts revealed that Johnson and Brandon Ennis beat and stabbed Strycker, set him on fire, and left him to die. \\xc2\\xa0Various prosecution witnesses identified Ennis as Johnson\\'s accomplice, and the jury heard about certain acts of Johnson and Ennis related to the murder of Strycker.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para6\"><span class=\"span0\"> </span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para5\"><span class=\"span0\">The prosecution eventually called Ennis. \\xc2\\xa0After Ennis took the oath, the State asked various questions, and Ennis told the jury he was currently a resident of Pendleton Reformatory in Indiana, identified Johnson in court, and said that they were friends. \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Ennis then identified a written warning and waiver of his </span>\\n<span class=\"span3\">Miranda</span>\\n<span class=\"span0\"> rights and said he had signed the waiver when he was picked up by the police. \\xc2\\xa0When the prosecutor asked Ennis who had requested the meeting that led to his signing the waiver, Ennis responded: \\xc2\\xa0\"I have the absolute right to remain silent, and I\\'m going to stand on it as from this point on.\" (R. at 335-36.) \\xc2\\xa0The prosecutor then asked Ennis to identify his written statement, but Ennis did not answer. \\xc2\\xa0The question was repeated, and again Ennis did not answer. \\xc2\\xa0</span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para6\"><span class=\"span0\"> \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0</span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para5\"><span class=\"span0\">At this point, the trial court decided to excuse the jury. \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0The State then resumed questioning Ennis, but he maintained his silence. \\xc2\\xa0The court held Ennis in contempt three times and finally told the State to \"pull Mr. Ennis off the stand at this time. \\xc2\\xa0I\\'ll [o]rder him held here and we\\'ll talk to him when we finish the other testimony later today.\" \\xc2\\xa0(R. at 341.) </span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para6\"><span class=\"span0\"></span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para5\"><span class=\"span0\">Before Ennis stepped down, the State offered to pass Ennis to the defense for cross-examination. \\xc2\\xa0The court prepared to bring the jury back in, but defense counsel asked for a bench conference, after which the court asked Ennis if he understood the consequences of his refusal to answer defense counsel\\'s questions. \\xc2\\xa0Ennis nodded yes. \\xc2\\xa0The court then dismissed the witness, saying \"We\\'ll talk to you later in the day.\" \\xc2\\xa0(R. at 343.) \\xc2\\xa0Defense counsel asked the court whether the defense would not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgo directly to cross-examination at this point?\" \\xc2\\xa0(R. at 343.) \\xc2\\xa0The judge said he did not want Ennis\\'s refusal to answer to occur in front of the jury, and asked the State to call its next witness. \\xc2\\xa0</span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para6\"><span class=\"span0\"></span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para5\"><span class=\"span0\">The jury returned, and the State called its next witness. \\xc2\\xa0Ennis was never recalled to the stand either by the defense or the prosecution. \\xc2\\xa0The record is bare of any further discussions concerning Ennis\\'s testimony. </span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para6\"><span class=\"span0\"></span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para5\"><span class=\"span0\">Defense counsel elicited from the State\\'s last witness the fact that Brandon Ennis had already been convicted of murder. \\xc2\\xa0Johnson testified on his own behalf during the trial. \\xc2\\xa0When Johnson took the stand, he testified that he had been told that Ennis had pled guilty to murdering Strycker.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para6\"><span class=\"span0\"></span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para5\"><span class=\"span0\">During closing statement, the defense twice mentioned Ennis\\xe2\\x80\\x99s refusal to testify, and reminded the jury that it could not consider that refusal in its deliberations. \\xc2\\xa0During the prosecution\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rebuttal, the State again referred to Ennis\\'s refusal and cautioned the jury it must disregard that refusal. \\xc2\\xa0The trial court gave a final instruction along the same lines. \\xc2\\xa0</span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para5\"><span class=\"span0\"></span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para7\"><span class=\"span2\"></span>\\n</p>\\n<p

contends he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to request an immediate limiting instruction following Ennis\\'s refusal to testify. \\xc2\\xa0Relying on </span>\\n<span class=\"span3\">Aubry v. State</span>\\n<span class=\"span0\">, 261 Ind. 692, 310 N.E.2d 556 (1974), and </span>\\n<span class=\"span3\">Tucker v. State</span>\\n<span class=\"span0\">, 534 N.E.2d 1110 (Ind. 1989), Johnson seeks to make this failure a per se finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. \\xc2\\xa0Johnson misreads our holdings in </span>\\n<span class=\"span3\">Aubrey</span>\\n<span class=\"span0\"> and </span>\\n<span class=\"span3\">Tucker</span>\\n<span class=\"span0\">. \\xc2\\xa0Those cases stand for the proposition that it is reversible error for the court to refuse to give such limiting instruction </span>\\n<span class=\"span4\">when requested to do so by the defense counsel</span>\\n<span class=\"span0\">.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para6\"><span class=\"span0\"></span>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"para5\"><span class=\"span0\">To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Johnson must show both deficient performance and resulting prejudice. \\xc2\\xa0</span>\\n<span class=\"span3\">Bouye v.

Barker, 809 N.E.2d 312 (Ind. 2004).  We decline\\nrehearing as to the issues addressed in our opinion.  Barker, however,\\nasserts that our opinion did not specifically address his claimed violation\\nof Article 1, Section 19, of the Constitution of Indiana.\\n\\nBarker raised the Section 19 issue in the trial court in memoranda\\nsupporting his motion to dismiss the death penalty.  This issue was not,\\nhowever, a basis on which the trial court granted his motion.  Barker\\nnevertheless did reassert and discuss the issue in four paragraphs within\\nthe argument section of his Brief of Appellee in this interlocutory appeal.\\n Brief of Appellee at 26.   We will therefore address this claim.[1]\\n\\nBarker contends that the United States Supreme Court\\'s decisions in Ring v.\\nArizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556 (2002), and\\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435\\n(2000), should alter the application of Article 1, Section 19 of the\\nIndiana Constitution, which provides: \"In all criminal cases whatever, the\\njury shall have the right to determine the law and the facts.\"  We have\\npreviously held that Section 19 does not apply to sentencing proceedings\\nand therefore is inapplicable in capital cases at the penalty phase.\\nPeterson v. State, 674 N.E.2d 528, 541 (Ind. 1996).  He argues that now\\nthat Ring and Apprendi treat aggravation and weighing as \"elements\"\\nrequiring a jury trial, Peterson and prior cases on which it is based\\nshould be overruled and that Section 19 should now be applied in penalty\\nphase proceedings, thus entitling a capital defendant to a jury\\ndetermination of his sentence.  Because Indiana Code \\xc2\\xa7 35-50-2-9(f) permits\\na death sentence to be imposed by a judge alone in cases where the jury\\ncannot reach a sentencing decision, Barker claims that the death penalty\\nstatute is facially unconstitutional under Section 19.\\n\\nIn our previous opinion we rejected Barker\\'s claim that Indiana\\'s amended\\ndeath penalty statute violates the federal Constitution because it contains\\na provision, Ind. Code \\xc2\\xa7 35-50-2-9(f), that permits a death sentence to be\\nimposed by a judge alone in cases where the jury cannot reach a sentencing\\ndecision.  Barker, 809 N.E.2d at 317.  We specifically held that such\\nprovision \"is not unconstitutional as written, but that it may not be\\nconstitutionally applied to permit a judge to impose a sentence where a\\njury has been unable to decide whether the aggravating circumstance or\\ncircumstances have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Id.  And as to\\noccasions when a jury finds that one or more aggravators are proven beyond\\na reasonable doubt but is unable to reach unanimous agreement on whether\\nany mitigating circumstances are outweighed by the aggravating\\ncircumstances, such weighing is not a \"fact\" and thus does not require jury\\ndetermination.  See Ritchie v. State, 809 N.E.2d 258 (Ind. 2004).\\n\\n      Barker does not present any showing that the framers and ratifiers of\\nthe Indiana Constitution intended Section 19 to guarantee a jury\\ndetermination of facts and law with respect to sentencing factors.  To the\\ncontrary, it has been recognized for over a century that the right to jury\\ntrial under the Indiana Constitution generally applies only to the finding\\nof guilt or innocence and not to the determination of punishment.  Miller\\nv. State, 149 Ind. 607, 619, 49 N.E. 894, 898 (1898).  To the extent that\\nour amended death penalty statute, as well as federal constitutional\\njurisprudence, now require the aggravating circumstances used in sentencing\\nto be found by a jury, it may be that such facts are governed by Section\\n19.  See Parker v. State, 698 N.E.2d 737, 742 (Ind. 1998), and Seay v.\\nState, 698 N.E.2d 732, 733 (Ind. 1998) (applying Section 19 to habitual\\noffender sentencing decisions that are assigned to juries by statute).  We\\ndecline, however, to extend the right of jury trial provided in Section 19\\nto the determination of \"weighing,\" which is not a \"fact\" necessarily\\nrequiring a jury decision under Indiana Code \\xc2\\xa7 35-50-2-9(f).  We decline\\nBarker\\'s request that we overrule Peterson and reject his claim that\\nIndiana\\'s death penalty statute violates Article 1, \\xc2\\xa719 of the Indiana\\nConstitution.\\n\\nHaving rejected Barker\\'s claim of Indiana Constitutional violation, we\\nreach the same conclusion as our previous opinion now challenged by this\\npetition for rehearing.  Accordingly, the trial court\\'s order of June 27,\\n2003, finding that Indiana code \\xc2\\xa735-50-2-9 is unconstitutional and\\ndismissing the state\\'s request for the death penalty, is reversed.  We\\nremand for reinstatement of the State\\'s death penalty request and for\\npenalty phase proceedings as previously ordered by this Court.\\n\\n\\nShepard, C.J., and Sullivan and Boehm, JJ., concur.  Rucker, J., concurs\\nexcept as to the decision to deny rehearing on the question of whether the\\nweighing requirement of Indiana\\'s capital sentencing statute is a factor\\nthat must be submitted to jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  On\\nthis issue his view is expressed in Barker v. State, 809 N.E.2d 312, 319\\n(Rucker, J., concurring in result).\\n\\n-----------------------\\n[1]    Baker\\'s Brief of Appellee also asserted that the capital sentencing\\nstatute\\'s direction to provide special verdicts violates the separation of\\npowers doctrine under Article 3, Section 1, of the Indiana Constitution.\\nBrief of Appellee at 27-28.  His petition for rehearing does not request\\nexplicit consideration of this claim, and we deem the claim to be abandoned\\nand procedurally forfeited.\\n\\n",

Lowe, Judge\\n\\nNee ee eee eee SS\\n\\n \\n\\nReversed and Remanded\\n\\n \\n\\nIn this interlocutory appeal, the employer challenges the trial court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s denial of its motion\\nfor summary judgment, which was based on the election of remedies doctrine. The\\nemployee, a Georgia resident, alleged injuries as a result of a work-related motor vehicle\\naccident that occurred in Tennessee. The Tennessee employer filed a Tennessee First\\nReport of Injury and paid for the employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emergency medical care in Tennessee, but\\nsubsequently denied benefits based on a dispute as to causation. The employee retained\\ncounsel and filed a claim for workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 compensation benefits in Georgia. After\\nconducting extensive discovery in the Georgia claim, the employee filed a petition for\\nbenefits in Tennessee but continued to pursue his claim in Georgia. Following a hearing\\nbefore the Georgia State Board of Workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Compensation, the claim was dismissed for\\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction. After the employee filed an amended petition seeking\\nbenefits in Tennessee, the employer filed a motion for summary judgment asserting the\\nemployee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Tennessee claim was barred because he had made a binding election of\\nremedies by pursuing his claim in Georgia. Concluding that the Georgia dismissal did\\nnot address the merits of the employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim, the trial court denied the employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmotion. The employer has appealed. Having carefully reviewed the record, we reverse\\nthe trial court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision and remand the case for entry of an order granting the\\nemployer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion for summary judgment.\\n\\nJudge David F.
